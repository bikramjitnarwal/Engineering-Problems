All labs and projects were made with the use of Matlab. They were made for MAT188 (Linear Algebra) at the University of Toronto. 

Here are some concepts that are incorporated in the labs:

1) Do basic numeric calculations through the use of MATLAB’s built-in functions and the use of element-by-element or dot operations, 
2) Approximate analytic functions using discretization by defining and calculating appropriate vectors and matrices, 
3) Import data into the MATLAB environment, 
4) Do basic symbolic calculations in MATLAB, 
5) Generate a best polynomial curve fit to a data set, using MATLAB’s built-in functions, 
6) Create 2D and 3D figures with multiple plots, grids, proper labels, titles, and legends to clearly visualize functions and data, 
7) Access and change parts of a matrix, through proper matrix indexing, 
8) Write simple scripts by collecting MATLAB commands in a single .m file, 
9) Use for loops and conditional statements to carry out numeric computation and mathematical modelling exercises, 
10) Seek help through the built-in help utility, online documentation, and online support tutorials, 
11) Understand key elements of the Engineer’s Toolbox, including discretization, visualization, and mathematical modelling
